# What is MinionOS?
MinionOS or MiniOS is a little program made for windows XP
### But it's 2025!!!
i do not care. I have an old medion and it works perfectly
# Warning!
put choice.exe in system32 file or else it won't work
## Compatibility
As i said before this is for windows xp. This can also be used in windows 11.
I don't really recommend it. You have to change the names of the exe and in the batch files.
I will soon create another versions for other operative systems.
It is also a joke program so don't take it seriously
### Settings
there are a couple of settings;
annoying - set false by default
windows - set 10 by default
program - set false by default
